# WeWantWaste UI Interview

## Design Approach
- ‚Å†Since all items look the same the grid view is not necessary, opted to use single item view with option seletion dropdown.
- For the provided dataset, only Skip size has unique values. Hire period is all the same, so the hire period is by default selected.
- Assuming that the format of the data set provided is final, we may remove the hire period dropdown entirely.
- I have added a few tests - production app should have 95% + test coverage.
